A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon used by [[Indigenous Australians]] for hunting.Boomerangs have been historically used for [[Hunting in Australia|hunting]], as well as a sport, and entertainment. They are commonly thought of as an Australian icon,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Boomerang: Behind an Australian Icon|last = Jones|first = Philip|publisher = Wakefield Press|year = 1996|isbn = 9781862543829|location = |pages = }}</ref> and come in various shapes and sizes.== Description ==[[File:Boomerang (PSF).jpg|thumb|A boomerang returns to the point from where it was sent]]A boomerang is traditionally a long wooden device, although historically boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones.  Modern boomerangs used for sport are often made from thin aircraft plywood, plastics such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[polypropylene]], [[phenolic paper]], or even high-tech materials such as [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre-reinforced plastics]]. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumblestick, the Boomabird and many other less common types.An important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning Boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air human-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more [[airfoil]] wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced [[aerodynamic]] forces that curve its path so that it travels in an [[Ellipse|elliptical]] path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a [[throwing stick]] can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game. Its surfaces therefore are symmetrical and not uneven like the aerofoils which give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.The most recognisable type of the boomerang is the L-shaped returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or shaunies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten [[game (food)|game]] birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of [[#Modern use|various shapes or sizes]].Historical evidence also points to the use of non-returning boomerangs by the Native Americans of California and [[Arizona]], and inhabitants of southern [[India]] for killing birds and rabbits.<ref name="Brittanica">{{cite encyclopedia |title = Boomerang |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/73646/boomerang |accessdate= 25 January 2009 }}</ref> Indeed, some boomerangs were not thrown at all, but were used in [[hand to hand combat]] by [[Indigenous Australians]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Tom |url= http://www.howstuffworks.com/boomerang.htm/printable |title= Battle Boomerangs |publisher= Howstuffworks.com |date= |accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref> Ancient Egyptian examples, however, have been recovered, and experiments have shown that they functioned as returning boomerangs.<ref>Rivers, Pitt.

It is further supposed by some that this was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Lloyd |first1= John |last2= Mitchinson |first2= John |title= The Book of General Ignorance |year=2006 |publisher= Mackays of Chatham |isbn= 978-0-571-23368-7 |page= 244 }}</ref> In southeastern Australia, it is claimed that boomerangs were made to hover over a flock of ducks; mistaking it for a hawk, the ducks would dive away, toward hunters armed with nets or clubs.<ref name=":0" /> Despite these notions and similar claims by a few European writers, there is no independently contemporaneous record of any aboriginal peoples using a returning boomerang as a weapon.Traditionally, most boomerangs used by aboriginal groups in Australia were 'non-returning'. These weapons, sometimes called "throwsticks" or "kylies", were used for hunting a variety of prey, from [[kangaroo]]s to parrots; at a range of about {{convert|100|m}}, a 2-kg (4.4 lb) non-returning boomerang could inflict mortal injury to a large animal.<ref name=":0" /> A throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees, while the long-necked emu could be killed by a blow to the neck.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Hooked non-returning boomerangs, known as "beaked kylies", used in northern Central Australia, have been claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock. It should be noted that throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's aboriginal peoples, and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together.== Design ==[[File:Boomerangs - melbourne show 2005.jpg |thumb|left|Boomerangs for sale at the 2005 Melbourne Show]]A returning boomerang is a rotating wing. Though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an [[airfoil]].As the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, this creates airflow over the wings and this creates lift on both "wings". However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip-speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.<ref name=hyper>{{cite web |url= http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html |title= Boomerang |work=gsu.edu}}</ref>While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, gyroscopic effect causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, and this is what curves the flight in such a way that it will tend to return.<ref name=hyper/>Thus [[gyroscopic precession]] is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a [[Flying disc|Frisbee]], but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane.Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.baggressive.com/copper/thumbnails.php?album=6 |title= 'baggressive.com' |publisher= Baggressive.com |date= 19 April 2005 |accessdate= 3 March 2010}}</ref> Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximise the boomerang's hover-time in descending from the highest point in its flight.Some boomerangs have [[turbulator]]s—bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation).=== Modern construction ===<!-- Much of this section is written as if it is a how-to article, and may also be a possible cut-and-paste move that was slightly edited. This section should be edited to conform to a proper encyclopedic style. -->{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}The pattern is placed on the plywood so that the wood grain runs across from the tip of one end of the boomerang to the tip of the other end. Try to get the grain of the outer ply running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms.  If there is any warp in the wood, make sure that this produces dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang, i.e., if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface, then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface.  (Any anhedral and the boomerang won't fly.) The pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil. The boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood. This basic cut out is called the blank. An outline is drawn on the top of the blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings. The profiles of the wings are shaped. The top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45° angle, while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 1–2&nbsp;mm thick trailing edge. The bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly. The tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge. The various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes. A shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing. For example, this might consist of a 5-cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge. Using progressively finer sandpaper, the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully.  Check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral (2–3&nbsp;mm) on both wings at this point.  If there isn't any, introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven (about 30 seconds on high) – if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle, you've got it just about right.  Bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight (bag of sugar?) on the elbow of the boomerang.  Allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more.  After spraying the surface with sanding sealer, the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool. The boomerang is then painted again.=== Tuning the flight ==={{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}The boomerang is then thrown several times to check if it works. The extreme subtleties of the [[aerodynamic]] forces on the light wooden boomerang make it surprisingly difficult to predict how the finished boomerang will perform. Two apparently identical boomerangs may radically differ in their flight patterns. For example, they may climb uncontrollably, they may fall repeatedly into the ground, they may exhibit long narrow pattern non-returning flight, or display other erratic behaviour. The only sure way to know is to flight-test them. There are several methods to correct problems, for example the wing profiles might be adjusted by additional sanding. Plywood boomerangs may be heated for a short time in a [[microwave oven]] which softens the glue between the layers and then can be carefully intentionally warped. [[Angle of attack]] of the leading arm and the dingle arm can be adjusted, as can the overall [[dihedral angle]] of the wings all with some effect. There are many other esoteric tuning techniques as well. Tuning boomerangs is more of a slowly learned art than a science. The quality of the boomerang is also checked throughout this process. A tuned boomerang should be stored carefully on a flat surface away from too much humidity, direct sunlight, or heat. These conditions can subtly affect the shape of the boomerang and ruin its flight characteristics, and the boomerang will then need to be re-tuned.The hunting boomerang is more delicately balanced and is therefore much harder to make than a returning one. When thrown, this type of boomerang needs to develop no unbalanced aerodynamic forces that would affect its flight path, so that it will fly true to the target.=== Art renaissance ==={{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}Beginning in the later part of the twentieth century, there has been a bloom in the independent creation of unusually designed art boomerangs. These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects often do not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. As long as there are somewhere in the object several airfoil contoured surfaces, whether wing shaped or not, these boomerangs can be thrown and will return. Designs are amazingly diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse.== Throwing technique =={{Refimprove section|date=June 2012}}A right-handed boomerang is thrown with a counter-clockwise spin causing a counter-clockwise flight (as seen from above). Conversely, a left-handed boomerang is constructed as a mirror image with the aerofoils' leading edges on the left side of the wings, as seen from above, causing it to produce lift when circling clockwise. Although appearing symmetrical from a plan view, the leading edges are on opposite edges of the wings (leading and trailing) so as to present the leading edges of the aerofoil to the wind when spinning.[[File:Boomerang School.JPG|thumb|right|A boomerang school, William Street, Kings Cross, Sydney]]Most sport boomerangs are in the range of about {{convert|70|to|110|g|oz}}. The range on most is between {{cvt|20|and|40|m|yd|0}}. Boomerangs are generally thrown in treeless, large open spaces that are twice as large as the range of the boomerang. A right- or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower. Throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers may find awkward.The correct launch orientation makes the boomerang's flight begin by flying into the wind, then having its flight take it through the "eye of the wind" and finally returning downwind using the wind's speed to help complete its flight back to the thrower. It is the spin that makes the boomerang return and the strength of throw and spin must be varied according to the speed of the wind – the stronger the wind, the less power is required to provide lift enough to make the return journey. In other words, the stronger the wind, the softer the boomerang is thrown. A light wind of three to five miles per hour is considered ideal. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then it is usually too strong for boomerangs.Properly thrown boomerang should curve around to the left, climb gently, level out in mid-flight, arc around and descend slowly, and then finish by popping up slightly, hovering, then stalling near the thrower. Ideally, this momentary hovering or stalling will allow the catcher the opportunity to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands.== Competitions and records ==In international competition, a ''world cup'' is held every second year. {{as of|2017}}, teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition. The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2016 by Swiss thrower [[Manuel Schütz]]. In 1992, 1998, 2006 and 2008 [[Fridolin Frost]] from Germany won the title.The team competitions of 2012 and 2014 were won by Boomergang (an international team). World champions were Germany in 2012 and Japan in 2014 for the first time. Boomergang was formed by individuals from several countries, including the Colombian [[Alejandro Palacio]]. In 2016 USA became team world champion.=== Competition disciplines ===Modern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below<ref name="German Wikipedia">Based on original text from German wiki.[[:de:Bumerang]]{{Better source|date=November 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} from the thrower. Throwing takes place individually. The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field.Events include:* ''Aussie Round'': considered by many to be the ultimate test of boomeranging skills. The boomerang should ideally cross the {{convert|50|m|ft|adj=on}} circle and come right back to the centre. Each thrower has five attempts. Points are awarded for distance, accuracy and the catch.* ''Accuracy'': points are awarded according to how close the boomerang lands to the centre of the rings. The thrower must not touch the boomerang after it has been thrown. Each thrower has five attempts. In major competitions there are two accuracy disciplines: Accuracy 100 and Accuracy 50.* ''Endurance'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved in 5 minutes.* ''Fast Catch'': the time taken to throw and catch the boomerang five times. The winner has the fastest timed catches.* ''Trick Catch/Doubling'': points are awarded for trick catches behind the back, between the feet, and so on. In Doubling the thrower has to throw two boomerangs at the same time and catch them in sequence in a special way.* ''Consecutive Catch'': points are awarded for the number of catches achieved before the boomerang is dropped. The event is not timed.* ''MTA 100'' (''Maximal Time Aloft'', {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}): points are awarded for the length of time spent by the boomerang in the air. The field is normally a circle measuring 100&nbsp;m. An alternative to this discipline, without the 100&nbsp;m restriction is called ''MTA unlimited''.* ''Long Distance'': the boomerang is thrown from the middle point of a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline. The furthest distance travelled by the boomerang away from the baseline is measured. On returning, the boomerang must cross the baseline again but does not have to be caught.

In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an [[infinity|infinite]] [[Vertical angles|vertical]] [[extrusion|extrude]] of a {{convert|40|m|yd|adj=on}} large line centred on the thrower. Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and the thrower is happy whenever he/she does not have to travel {{convert|50|m|yd}} after the throw, to recover the boomerang.=== General properties ===Long-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return. For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.Today's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an ''S'' or ''? – question mark'' shape and have a [[bevel]]ed edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass [[epoxy]] composites.=== Flight path ===The projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a [[Drop (liquid)|water drop]]. For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent. Nowadays, boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.From theoretical point of view, distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its [[derivative]] crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The [[kinetic energy]] of the forward component is then stored in the [[potential energy]]. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).== Related terms ==In [[Noongar language]], ''kylie'' is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals.<ref>{{cite web |title= Language {{!}} Kaartdijin Noongar |url= https://www.noongarculture.org.au/language/ |website= www.noongarculture.org.au |publisher= SWLASC |accessdate= 6 February 2017}}</ref>"Kylie" is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bumerang-sport.de/story/history.htm|title=Whence comes, and what is a boomerang|website=www.bumerang-sport.de|access-date=2017-07-26}}</ref> Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers. They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent. The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning "boomerang" taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] word "karli".== See also ==* [[Batarang]]* [[Bat'leth]]* [[Captain Boomerang]]* [[Chakram]]* [[Commonwealth Boomerang]], a [[World War II]] fighter-plane* [[Frisbee]]* [[Shuriken]]* [[Throwing stick]]* [[Valari]]== References =={{reflist|30em}}== Further reading ==* [http://www.answers.com/topic/boomerang Boomerang Ask.com] Design, Throwing, Flight Path.* [[Yutaka Nishiyama]], [http://www.kbn3.com/bip/index2.html Instructions of Paper Boomerangs in 70 Languages], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HZOLjFK0M Flight of paper boomerang]* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/boomerang.aspx Boomerang]* Valde-Nowak ''et al''.

It is a Class A – Advanced team in the [[California League]], and is a [[farm team]] of the [[San Diego Padres]]. The Storm plays its home games at [[Lake Elsinore Diamond]] (Pete Lehr Field), which opened in 1994; the park seats 7,866 fans.This team relocated three times and has been traced back to the [[Redwood Pioneers]], then the [[Palm Springs Angels]], and finally the Lake Elsinore Storm.

Nevin's skill and pace made him a pivotal player at Chelsea and he very soon became firm favourite with the fans.In [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]], he scored 14 goals, created numerous others for the likes of Dixon and Speedie and put in some dazzling performances{{cn|date=February 2017}} – during a 4–0 win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], he tormented the opposition defence, leaving five defenders trailing in his wake – as Chelsea won promotion as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] champions. In the same season he was voted Chelsea's player of the year. Chelsea finished a respectable sixth in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] the following year and reached the [[Football League Cup|Milk Cup]] (League Cup) semi-final, where Nevin was once again the star turn, setting up three goals in the quarter-final against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as Chelsea came back from 3–0 down to draw 4–4; he also set up the winner for Speedie in the replay. The club were in the title race for much of the next season, with Nevin scoring a late equaliser against Liverpool at [[Anfield]] and a crucial header against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] to seal a 2–1 win, though a late collapse saw Chelsea finish sixth after being in the title race for most of the [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86 season]]. A year later, the club's performances dropped and they finished 14th, though Nevin was again voted Chelsea player of the year. They were relegated a year later.===Everton===Chelsea were relegated in 1988 and Nevin was sold to Everton for £1.75m. He scored 20 goals in 138 appearances for the club, but struggled to re-capture his previous form with manager [[Colin Harvey]] adopting a far more rigid system. He helped the side reach the [[FA Cup]] final in 1989, scoring the winner against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in the semi-final, but they lost 3–2 in the final to arch-rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].[[Howard Kendall]] returned to the club as manager in November 1990; he and Nevin openly disagreed with each other, which reduced Nevin's playing opportunities, as did the arrival of new wingers [[Robert Warzycha]] and [[Mark Ward (footballer born 1962)|Mark Ward]].Nevin was unfortunate to arrive at Everton just after one of the finest spells in their history, when they had collected two league titles, an [[FA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]]. In contrast, Nevin's four seasons at the club saw a runners-up medal in the [[FA Cup]] (1989) being the closest he came to being part of a trophy winning side, and they never finished higher than sixth in the league (1990).===Tranmere Rovers===Nevin spent time on loan with fellow [[Merseyside]] club [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], then in the second tier of [[Football in England|English football]], before signing permanently in 1992. The club competed in the Division One play-offs in three consecutive seasons (1992–93, 1993–94 and 1994–95) but on each occasion they were eliminated in the semi-final.===Return to Scotland===In 1997, Nevin returned to Scotland and played for [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and later [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] before retiring in 2000.==International career==In 1982 while playing for Clyde, he travelled to [[Finland]] to play for the [[Scotland national under-19 football team|Scotland U18]] team at the [[1982 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship|UEFA European Youth Championship]] and was named player of the tournament after helping Scotland win it. The following year, he starred for the [[Scotland national under-20 football team|Scotland U20]] team that reached the quarter-finals of the [[1983 FIFA World Youth Championship|FIFA World Youth Championship]].Nevin won 28 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national side]], making his debut against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in 1986. He scored five goals in a ten-year international career and played at [[1992 European Football Championship|Euro 92]], but was not selected in the final squads for the [[FIFA World Cup 1986|1986]] or [[FIFA World Cup 1990|1990]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s. He made his final appearance for Scotland in 1996 but did not appear at the [[Euro 96]] finals.==Career after playing==After retiring as a player, Nevin had a stint as chief executive of Motherwell. He resigned from the position in April 2002 after chairman John Boyle decided to place the club in administration due to serious financial problems.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/1948121.stm |title=Motherwell in turmoil |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=24 April 2002 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref>He works as a football pundit on television and radio, including for the [[BBC Scotland|BBC's]] ''[[Sportscene]]'' and ''[[Match of the Day 2]]'', for [[Five (TV)|Channel Five]] and [[BBC Radio Five Live]].<ref name = "bbc bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/radiofivelive/patnevin.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205151355/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/biographies/biogs/radiofivelive/patnevin.shtml |archivedate=5 December 2010 |title=Pat Nevin |publisher=[[BBC]] Press Office |accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref> Nevin co-wrote a book, ''In Ma Head, Son'', with psychologist Dr George Sik that was published in 1997.

Sarpsborg 08 played in [[Adeccoligaen]] from 2005 to 2010. In 2010, the club was promoted to the [[Tippeligaen]], the top league in [[Norway]], but finished last and was relegated back to [[Adeccoligaen]] in 2011. In 2012, they were promoted again. They play their home games at [[Sarpsborg Stadion]].==History==Football in [[Sarpsborg]] has traditionally been dominated by [[Sarpsborg FK]] (SFK), which won the [[Norwegian Football Cup|Norwegian Cup]] six times and played 20 seasons in the top division, and to a lesser extent [[IL Sparta]], which won the Norwegian Cup in [[1952 Norwegian Football Cup|1952]] and played nine seasons in the top division. However, after SFK's relegation from the [[1974 Norwegian First Division|1974]], no teams from Sarpsborg played in the top division for the next two decades. In 1999, 16 teams in the Sarpsborg-area joined forces to create a team that could compete in the top divisions of Norwegian football, called '''Sarpsborg Fotball''', which overtook SFK's spot in the league-system. In its first season the team was relegated from the [[2000 Norwegian Second Division|Second Division]], and several clubs including both SFK and Sparta, withdrew from the collaboration.The remaining clubs in the "Sarpsborg Fotball"-project formed a new club called '''Borg Fotball''', which won promotion to the [[Norwegian Second Division|Second Division]] in 2002, but was relegated again in 2003. Meanwhile, Sparta was promoted to the Second Division the same season, and re-entered the collaboration club which now was renamed '''FK Sparta Sarpsborg'''. The club earned promotion to [[Adeccoligaen]] (the second tier of Norwegian football) in 2005.At the end of the 2007 season, the last major club in the district, Sarpsborg FK, joined the collaboration of teams and ended a rather long and hefty rivalry between the two clubs. At the same time, in an effort to unite the different fractions within the collaboration, the jersey was changed and the club renamed itself '''Sarpsborg Sparta FK'''. This name remained a source of contention throughout the 2008 season, however, and a new name, '''Sarpsborg 08 FF''', was adopted in 2009.The 2009 season started badly for Sarpsborg, and it appeared they would be fighting against relegation to the Second Division. The situation worsened when the [[Football Association of Norway]] determined that Sarpsborg 08 had submitted an unrealistic budget when they obtained their license to play in the First Division, and were penalized three points in June, leaving Sarpsborg in a relegation spot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/06/25/sport/fotball/1_divisjon/sarpsborg_08/6895626/|title=Mister tre poeng og havner på nedrykksplass|last=Haraldsen|first=Stian|date=2009-06-25|publisher=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref> However, after [[Roar Johansen (football coach)|Roar Johansen]] became coach, the second part of the season went well for the team, which not only climbed out of the relegation spots, but finished fifth, allowing them to participate in the qualification matches for the [[2010 Norwegian Premier League]].

But after a good start, Sarpsborg was relegated back to [[Adeccoligaen]] on 23 October 2011, when they lost 3–0 away at [[SK Brann|Brann]] with three rounds left to play.On 3 January 2013, former Sheffield United striker [[Brian Deane]] was appointed as coach.== Recent history ==:{|class="wikitable"|-bgcolor="#efefef"!

He is a member of the Board of Contributors for ''[[USA Today]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Forum Page, part of the newspaper's Opinion section. He received the [[Margaret Edwards Award]] from the [[American Library Association]] in 2001 for his contribution in writing for teens.<ref name=edwards/>==Personal background==Lipsyte was born on January 16, 1938, in [[New York City]], the son of Fanny (Finston) and Sidney I. Lipsyte. He grew up in [[Rego Park, Queens|Rego Park]], a neighborhood in the [[New York city]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]].<ref>Lipsyte, Robert. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DD1231F931A15753C1A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 "COPING; My Bullied Days: A Smart Fat Kid's Story"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 22, 1995. Accessed October 11, 2007. "Rego Park was predominately Jewish, and most of the bullying had no ethnic edge."</ref> Lipsyte’s father was a school principal, his mother a teacher. Young Robert devoted his childhood to books rather than sports. Instead of sharing a game of catch with his father, the two often visited the library. Robert's son, [[Michael Jackson]], is also an author and teacher at [[Columbia University]] in New York.In the first chapter of his 1976 book ''SportsWorld'', which considers the role of sports in American culture, Lipsyte points out that he did not even attend his first major league baseball game until he was thirteen years old, despite the fact that there were three major league teams in New York: the Yankees, the Giants, and the Dodgers. Lipsyte says he was “profoundly disappointed” with his experience at the game and so went to only one more game “as a paying customer.” His third major league game was as a sports reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]''.As a boy, Lipsyte did play [[Chinese handball]] against the sides of brick buildings and participated in street games such as [[stickball]], but he felt acute pressure to excel at sports which discouraged his interest. This experience later developed into a major theme in some of Lipsyte’s nonfiction works such as ''SportsWorld'' and novels like ''Jock and Jill'' (1982) and his trilogy beginning with ''One Fat Summer'' (1977). The protagonist of ''One Fat Summer'', Bobby Marks, is similar to Lipsyte: Bobby is an adolescent in the 1950s, suffering from a weight problem, who does something about it. In 1952, Lipsyte took a summer job as a lawn boy and lost forty pounds, ridding himself of the youthful stigma of excess weight.==Television==Lipsyte has done work as a correspondent for both CBS and NBC, in addition to an Emmy-winning stint as host of WNET/Thirteen's "The Eleventh Hour" in the late 1980s.<ref>Lipsyte, Robert. [http://www.robertlipsyte.com/bio.htm "Biography"], Personal Website, Accessed June 2, 2011. "I've been a correspondent for CBS and NBC and had a nightly public affairs show on the PBS station in New York, WNET Channel 13 for which I won an Emmy."</ref>==Works of nonfiction==Much of Lipsyte’s nonfiction deals with sports, but here again he rarely takes a conventional approach. He is especially concerned that children are subjected to sports in negative ways. Sports should be fun and entertaining; winning need not be the only goal. Although he is not anti-sport, he is disillusioned by a culture of champions that he calls “Sportsworld.” SportsWorld, as Lipsyte points out in the book by that name, “is a grotesque distortion of sports.” It honors the winner more than the race. As illustrated in ''[[The Contender (Robert Lipsyte novel)|The Contender]]'', Lipsyte values the process more than the result; competing well is more important than winning itself.Lipsyte was among the first to accept and respect the [[heavyweight (boxing)|heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champ [[Muhammad Ali]]. His agreement that Ali should be allowed to be himself is echoed in the title of his 1978 book on the complicated man: "Free to Be Muhammad Ali".He co-authored comedian and social activist [[Dick Gregory]]'s 1964 autobiography, ''[[Nigger (1964 book)|Nigger]]''.In 1978, Robert Lipsyte was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]]. Despite his eventual recovery from that first bout, he was diagnosed with [[cancer]] a second time in 1991. His experience with the illness led to another novel for young adults, The Chemo Kid (1992). In it, the [[protagonist]], Fred Bauer, an ordinary high school junior in almost every way, discovers he has cancer and undergoes a series of experimental hormone treatments. Miraculously, Fred acquires superpowers, apparently due to the treatments, and becomes “The Chemo Kid,” fighting for the environment and against drug dealers.An adult consideration of cancer, and sickness in general, is Lipsyte’s 1998 nonfiction work, "In the Country of Illness". Here, he speaks of infirmity as if it is a foreign land, a place he calls “Malady . . . another country, scary and strange.” Basing his accounts on his own experiences, as well as those of other family members, he comforts, advises, warns, and informs the reader with tenderness, insight, and wit. Lipsyte’s second wife, Margie, learned that she had [[breast cancer]] after their divorce. Especially moving is the account of Lipsyte’s second wife Margie’s failing health, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, and the strength shown by Margie and their two young adult children.In a 2009 interview with SportsMediaGuide, Lipsyte said that he has come to realize "that most jocks are sissies&nbsp;...".<ref>http://sportsmediaguide.com/interviews/robert-lipsyte/.

Edwards Award]] recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for "significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature". Lipsyte won the annual award in 2001, citing four books published from 1967 to 1993. According to the citation, "''The Contender'' and its sequels, ''The Brave'' and ''The Chief'' transformed the sports novel to authentic literature with their gritty depiction of the boxing world. An ongoing theme is the struggle of their protagonists to seek personal victory by their continuing efforts towards a better life despite defeats. The same theme appears in the humorous ''One Fat Summer'', in which an overweight boy deals with the timeless angst of body image. Lipsyte's books focus on the search for self-definition by young adults."<ref name=edwards/>At one point, ''One Fat Summer'' was removed from the syllabus of the [[Levittown, New York]] public school system after complaints were made about its depiction of its teenage protagonist's sexual fantasies. The decision was criticized by educators, civil libertarians, and the author [[Judy Blume]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/nyregion/a-1977-comes-under-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=1</ref>==See also=={{Portal bar |Children's literature |Sports }} <!-- delete "bar" if/when there are enough ordinary See also -->==References=={{Reflist |25em |refs=<ref name=edwards>[http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklistsawards/bookawards/margaretaedwards/maeprevious/2001awardwinner "2001 Margaret A.

The eight seeded players each received a bye into the second round. The format also changed from a straight matchplay (legs) to sets. Each set was the best of 5 legs. - For matches in the opening rounds the matches were best of three sets, - best of five for the quarter-finals and semi-finals, with the final being best of 9 sets, split over an afternoon and evening session with the play-off for third held in between.Defending champion, [[Leighton Rees]] of Wales again progressed to the final where he met [[John Lowe]] in a repeat of the inaugural championship. This time, Lowe was the top seed and came out on top in the final by 5 sets to 0.<ref name="hickoksports1"/>==New players==With the expansion from 16 to 24 players in the finals, 11 players made their championship debuts, the most notable being John Wilson of Scotland, - no doubt to be soon known as Jocky. Wilson's performances over 1978 had enabled him to be seeded 8th for the tournament, and thus ensure a place in round 2 straight away.==Seeds==Wilson entering the seeds meant he would replace Rab Smith, the Scot having to play the first round before moving into the later stages. England's John Lowe had risen to be number 1 seed, with Eric Bristow dropping to 2nd seed after his first round defeat a year earlier. Leighton Rees remained seeded 3, with Tony Brown moving up to number 4. The Semi-Finalist from 1978 Nicky Virachkul was seeded 5th with the other Last 4 man, Stefan Lord seeded 6th. Alan Evans was the 7th seed along with Wilson as 8th.# {{flagicon|ENG}} [[John Lowe]]# {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Eric Bristow]]# {{flagicon|WAL}} [[Leighton Rees]]# {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Tony Brown (darts player)|Tony Brown]]# {{flagicon|USA}} [[Nicky Virachkul]]# {{flagicon|SWE}} [[Stefan Lord]]# {{flagicon|WAL}} [[Alan Evans]]# {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Jocky Wilson]]==First round - Friday 2 and Saturday 3 February==The second Embassy World Championship opened up with the first surprise, Doug McCarthy's 2-1 win over Charlie Ellix. - McCarthy would meet Lowe in the last 16 later on in the event.

In 1979, he started his own film production company, Orenthal Productions, which dealt mostly in made-for-TV fare such as the family-oriented ''[[Goldie and the Boxer]]'' films with [[Melissa Michaelsen]] (1979 and 1981), and ''Cocaine and Blue Eyes'' (1983), the pilot for a proposed detective series on [[NBC]].NBC was considering whether to air ''Frogmen,'' another series starring Simpson, when his arrest in 1994 on charges of murder canceled the project.<ref name="lowry20000508">{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2000/may/08/entertainment/ca-27673 | title=The Saga of O.J.'s Last, Lost Pilot | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Lowry, Brian | date=May 8, 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>Besides his acting career, Simpson worked as a commentator for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and ''[[The NFL on NBC]].''<ref>{{cite web|title=History of ABC's Monday Night Football|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/2003/0115/1493105.html|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=January 15, 2003|accessdate=March 15, 2008}}</ref> He also appeared in the audience of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' during its second season and hosted an episode during its third season.<ref>{{cite episode|title=OJ Simpson/Ashford & Simpson|url=http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_84.shtml|series=[[Saturday Night Live]]|airdate=1978-02-25|network=[[NBC]]|season=3|number=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326163850/http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_84.shtml|archivedate=March 26, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>===''Frogmen''===Simpson starred in the un-televised two-hour-long [[film pilot]] for ''Frogmen,'' an ''[[The A-Team|A-Team]]''-like adventure series that [[Warner Bros. Television]] completed in 1994, a few months before the murders. NBC had not yet decided whether to order the series when Simpson's arrest cancelled the project. While searching his home, the police obtained a videotaped copy of the pilot as well as the script and [[dailies]]. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former [[United States Navy SEALs]], received "a fair amount of" military training—including use of a knife—for ''Frogmen,'' and there is a scene in which he holds a knife to the throat of a woman, this material was not introduced as evidence during the trial.<ref name="lowry20000508" />NBC executive [[Warren Littlefield]] said in July 1994 that the network would probably never air the pilot if Simpson were convicted; if he were acquitted, however, one television journalist speculated that "''Frogmen'' would probably be on the air before the [[NBC peacock]] could unfurl its plume".<ref name="jicha19940727">{{cite news | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-27/lifestyle/9407260286_1_littlefield-tv-movie-simpson-case | title=NBC May Bury Simpson TV Movie At Sea | work=Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel | date=July 27, 1994 | accessdate=April 24, 2014 | author=Jicha, Tom}}</ref> Most pilots that are two hours long are aired as TV movies whether or not they are ordered as series. Because—as the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' later reported—"the appetite for all things O.J. appeared insatiable" during the trial, Warner Bros. and NBC estimated that a gigantic, [[Super Bowl]]-like television audience would have watched the ''Frogmen'' film. One of Simpson's co-stars in the film commented that the studio's decision not to air it or even release it on home video, and forego an estimated $14&nbsp;million in profits, was "just about the only proof you have that there is some dignity in the advertising and television business".<ref name="lowry20000508"/>===''Juiced''===In 2006, Simpson starred in his own [[Improvisational theatre|improv]], hidden-camera prank TV show, ''Juiced.'' Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on everyday people while secretly filming them and at the end of each prank, he would shout, "You've been Juiced!" Less typical, each episode opened with topless strippers dancing around Simpson, who is dressed as a pimp. He sings his own rap song, which includes the lyrics "Don't you know there's no stopping the Juice / When I'm on the floor I'm like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don't be stupid, I'm not a Simpson named Bart." In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his white Bronco (made famous during the chase in Los Angeles prior to his arrest). A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they "ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.com/13393604/remembering-oj-simpsons-bizarre-prank-tv-show |title=Remembering O.J.

Website| http://www.myc.org.au|-|}'''Manly Yacht Club''' (MYC) is a [[sailing club]] in the [[suburb]] of [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] on the [[Northern Beaches (Sydney)|Northern Beaches]] of [[Sydney]], in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].== History ==Manly Yacht Club was formed in 1950 as the Manly 14&nbsp;ft Skiff Club. In the late 50's a training boat called the [[Manly Junior]] was introduced.The 60's was a busy decade with the formulation of the Yachting Division and the Manly Graduate division. The club's name was subsequently changed to the ManlyYacht Club. In the early 80's the club moved into the present building which was the site of the former Gentlemen's Baths, 'the largest and most efficiently equipped gentlemen's swimming baths in the state', opened in 1892. In October 1926, a new Olympic pool with a grandstand to seat 1400 people was opened at a cost of £11,000.The Baths suffered severe storm damage in May 1974[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/the-year-our-coastline-was-battered/story-fngr8hax-1226946127690] and were closed in April 1976[http://manlydiggers.org.au/history/]. The Harbord Diggers swimming club held a ceremony with special guests Sir Robert Askin and Fitz Lough, who had swum at the baths for seventy years. At the last race a wreath was floated in the pool. It was said that since the first race had been held in 1890 the pool had `seen more Olympic champions in action than any other swimming centre in this country.' Early in 1977 the Manly Yacht Club submitted plans to convert the remaining buildings for boat storage, and has been in residence ever since.==External links==* [http://www.myc.org.au Manly Yacht Club]* [http://www.manlysailability.com.au/ Manly Sailability]{{Coord|-33.80315|151.2854|format=dms|type:landmark_region:AU-NSW|display=title}}[[Category:Yacht clubs in Australia]][[Category:Sports clubs established in 1950]][[Category:1950 establishments in Australia]][[Category:Sporting clubs in Sydney]][[Category:Manly, New South Wales]])

It aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 6, 2010. In the episode, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] wants to become a [[NASCAR]] racer, but he feels that he cannot because he is not "poor and stupid enough" to fulfill his dream. After some experiments, his dream comes true, and he receives his own race car after his consumption of [[Vagisil]] brings massive attention to the product, much to the dismay of his friend [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], who tries to stop Cartman from giving his favorite event a bad reputation."Poor and Stupid" received a mixed reception. 3.139 million viewers watched the episode, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]], making it the second most watched cable television show of its airdate, losing the number one spot to the [[baseball]] game between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Minnesota Twins]] during the [[2010 American League Division Series]].==Plot==<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:South-park-poor-stupid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cartman's dream comes true when he races for NASCAR.{{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 8 March 2011}}]] -->When [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] find [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] crying in front of his locker at school, he explains that he's upset about the essay [[Mr. Garrison]] assigned, "What I Want to Be When I Grow Up." He wails that he dreams of being a [[NASCAR]] driver, but "a person like him" could never be that–he's nowhere near poor and stupid enough to be a NASCAR driver or fan. Immediately he turns to [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], who innocently confirms that he is a huge NASCAR fan. Dismayed at Cartman's views of NASCAR, Kenny, and himself, Stan and Kyle effectively convince him that he's actually very poor and very stupid. Cartman immediately turns to [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] for help in becoming as poor and stupid as possible: he gives Butters all his money and orders him to spend it all and never give it back. Then, while watching what he hopes is brain-cell-killing TV programming, he sees a commercial for [[Combe Incorporated|Vagisil]] that lists [[Anterograde amnesia|short-term memory loss]] as a possible side effect, so he shoplifts some and consumes it (quite literally, as he eats the cream meant for topical use). On race day, Butters convinces a driver to abandon his car because his wife has been raped, and Cartman hops into his car, but his total lack of knowledge causes an accident that lands him in the hospital. The doctor comments to Cartman, who's disappointed that he is not more seriously injured than he is, that his accident was the stupidest he has ever seen, which restores Cartman's hope. His antics cause the news media to wonder if all NASCAR fans are as stupid as he seems to be.An angered Kenny storms to Cartman's house just in time for a visit from Vagisil founder Jeff Hamill and his wife Patty. Since Cartman's determination has brought considerable attention to Vagisil, Hamill rewards him with his own Vagisil-sponsored racecar, further galling Kenny. Before his first race, Cartman posts bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast and the media concludes that "NASCAR really is just for the poor and stupid". Kenny decides that he must put a stop to Cartman. He tries to smuggle a hunting rifle into the racetrack, but it gets confiscated. He is however reassured that he can buy another in the gift shop.At Cartman's first race in his Vagisil car, he drives badly, crashing into other drivers, pulling [[Danica Patrick]] under the wheel, and mowing down spectators. When Kenny tries to interrupt, he's knocked onto the track; 2 cars crash to avoid him, leaving Cartman's the only car remaining in the race. Suddenly, Patty Hamill, fed up of her husband's disrespectful and condescending remarks toward her, gets onto the track and takes [[Jimmie Johnson]]'s damaged car. She beats Cartman and wins the race, much to Hamill's sheer disappointment, now that his company is ruined. Cartman apologizes to Kenny (who, surprisingly is still alive) for trying to become a NASCAR driver, and gives his future up, still believing that he is too smart for NASCAR. He demands that Butters give back his money, then yells at him for having done what he was told and gotten rid of it. Kenny watches in disbelief and confusion.== Production and theme  {{anchor|Production|ThemeCultural references}} ==[[File:TreyParkerHWOFApr2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] wrote and directed "Poor and Stupid".|alt=A brown-haired man wearing a lime shirt and grown jacket smiles and looks at something off-screen.]]"Poor and Stupid" was written and directed by series co-founder [[Trey Parker]], and was rated TV-MA-L-V in the United States.

He played for Budapest First Division club [[Nemzeti SC|Nemzeti]]  but his career was cut short by injury and he moved to Australia in the late 1940s.==Managerial career==In Australia, Vlasits moved into management, and coached New South Wales Division One side [[Bankstown Berries FC|Canterbury-Marrickville]] from 1958 to 1960, winning titles in 1958 and 1960 and winning the [[Waratah Cup|Ampol Cup]] in '58.

He then took over at fellow Division One side [[Sydney Olympic FC|Pan-Hellenic]] for 1963 and '64, but could only manage fourth- and sixth-place finishes. He then dropped down a league to Division Two side [[Bankstown City FC|Bankstown]], which placed sixth in his only year of management, 1965. He returned to Division One in 1966 with strugglers [[SSC Yugal]], which came third-last that season. A two-year stint at [[Parramatta FC|Melita Eagles-Newtown]] saw the club finish third-last in both the 1967 and '68 Division One seasons. He coached the Australian national side from 1967 to '69, and coached the team to victory in the [[1967 Quoc Khanh Cup]], winning all five matches they played.

He coached Australia for a total of 23 games — 13 wins, seven draws, and three losses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.socceroos.com.au/article/teams-of-the-decade--mens-1963-1970/15gwe4e644vel111n0jqpnv76v|title=Teams of the Decade <nowiki>|</nowiki> Men's 1963-1970|publisher=[[Australia national football team]]|date=18 December 2013|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref> He returned to Pan-Hellenic for the 1972 season, and the team came seventh in Division One.

The word ''Southwest'' appeared in white on the gold portion of the tail. On the original three 737-200s, from June 1971, on the left side of the aircraft, the word ''Southwest'' was placed along the upper rear portion of the fuselage, with the word ''Airlines'' painted on the tail [http://www.airliners.net/open.file/0111301/M/ N21SW]. On the right side, the word ''Southwest'' was on the tail, but also had the word ''Airlines'' painted on the upper rear portion of the fuselage.[http://www.airliners.net/open.file/0111315/M/ N20SW]. This was later revised to simply include "Southwest" on both sides of the tail. The airline's Boeing 727-200s, operated briefly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, featured other variations on the livery; one was painted in a shade of ochre instead of gold with stylized titles on the forward fuselage and an "S" logo on the tail, while others bore the standard livery (albeit in metallic gold) with the word "Southwest" moved from the tail to the forward fuselage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Southwest-Airlines-(Braniff-International-Airways)/Boeing-727-291/1450565|title=Aviation Photo #1450565: Boeing 727-291 - Southwest Airlines (Braniff International Airways)|author=|date=|work=airliners.net|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Southwest-Airlines/Boeing-727-227-Adv/682325|title=Aviation Photo #0682325: Boeing 727-227/Adv - Southwest Airlines|author=|date=|work=airliners.net|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref>[[File:Southwest 737-700, short NG, with big antenna cover on aft fuselage...

''Spirit One'' was the first aircraft painted in the canyon blue fleet color scheme. The second livery replaces the former primary color, "Desert Gold", with "Canyon Blue" and changes the Southwest text and pinstripes to gold. The orange and red stripes continued to be used. The pinstripe along the aircraft was drawn in a more curved pattern instead of the straight horizontal line separating the colors in the original. For aircraft equipped with blended winglets, the blended winglets were painted to include the text ''Southwest.com''. Southwest completed repainting its entire fleet with the new "Canyon Blue" livery in early 2010; however, ''The Colleen Barrett Classic'' (N714CB), ''The Herbert D. Kelleher One'' (N711HK) and ''The Metallic Gold One'' (N792SW), which are Boeing 737–700 aircraft, retained a simplified version of the original "Desert Gold" livery. The colors were Blue, Red and Orange. Also on the wings, the airlines web address, southwest.com. The Canyon Blue Aircraft is called the "Old Livery".[[File:SWA 737-700 N913WN.jpg|thumb|right|''Heart'' livery used 2014–present]]A new livery, named "Heart" and developed with firms [[GSD&M]], [[Lippincott]], VML, [[Razorfish (company)|Razorfish]], and Camelot Communications, was unveiled on September 8, 2014.<ref>{{Cite press release|title = Southwest unveils first new livery since 2001 |url = http://inairlinenews.com/2014/09/07/southwest-could-unveil-new-livery-monday/|date = 8 September 2014|publisher = In Airline News|accessdate = 8 September 2014|location = Dallas, TX}}</ref> The new livery uses a darker shade of blue. The orange stripe on the tail is changed to yellow; both the red and yellow stripes are now enlarged in reverse pattern; and the belly of the aircraft is now in blue and features a heart, which has been a symbol for Southwest during its 43-year history. Additionally, the pinstripes are changed to a silver-gray; and the Southwest text, now white, has been moved to the front of the fuselage. The colors for the new livery was Blue, Red and Yellow. Lettering is in a font custom designed by Monotype, Southwest Sans. The engines now feature the airline's web address, southwest.com.====Special liveries and decals====Some Southwest aircraft feature special liveries or are named with special decals. Southwest gives these aircraft special names, usually ending in "One." All special liveries painted prior to ''Spirit One'' originally wore the standard Desert Gold, red and orange colors on the vertical stabilizer and rudder. Subsequent special liveries featured tails with the canyon blue livery, with all earlier specials repainted with the Spirit livery tail. Aircraft painted in special liveries have white painted blended winglets with one exception: ''Warrior One'', which added the split scimitar winglet in May 2014.  ''Missouri One'' was the first special livery to feature a modified version of the ''Heart'' tail design, with the red and yellow ribbons shrunk in order to fit the Southwest wordmark as it is too large to be used on the fuselage as on other aircraft. Previous special livery aircraft are currently being repainted with the new tail design.<ref name=factsheet /><center>{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" border="1" cellpadding="3"!colspan="5"|Table of Southwest Airlines' special liveries<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swamedia.com/channels/By-Category/pages/specialty-aircraft |title=Southwest Airlines Newsroom: By Category |publisher=Swamedia.com |accessdate=2013-07-29}}</ref><br><small>(including photos)</small>|-!Name!Year!Description!Registration!Photo|-!colspan="5"|Active|-|2,000th "Next Generation" 737|2006|Southwest received the 2,000th "Next Generation" 737 produced on July 27, 2006.

He accompanied his father in travels through [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Bohemia]]. After his return to England he was placed at [[Westminster School]], 3 May 1592, under the tuition of [[Edward Grant (headmaster)|Edward Grant]] and Camden. [[Anthony Wood]] was informed that he subsequently studied at Oxford, but he took no degree, and his college is unknown.Settling in London with the intention of practising 'physic' (medicine) he exhibited at the door of his house a list of medicines which were said to be certain cures for many diseases. The censors of the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]] summoned him to appear before them; but it is not known with what outcome. Proceeding to Manchester, Dee  married Isabella, daughter of Edward Prestwych, justice of the peace.Through the recommendation of [[James I of England|James I]] he was appointed one of the physicians to the Tsar [[Michael I of Russia]]. He remained in [[Russia]] for about fourteen years, principally at [[Moscow]]. There he wrote his ''[[Fasciculus Chemicus]]'', a collection of writings on [[alchemy]].Returning to [[England]] upon the death of his wife in 1637, Dee became physician to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. Upon his retirement Arthur Dee resided in [[Norwich]], where he became a friend of [[Sir Thomas Browne]]. His relationship to Browne has been little explored, one literary critic speculating of this relationship,{{quote|Little is known of this son of Dee's; one cannot help but wonder however, how much he may have influenced Browne, who was one of the seventeenth century's greatest literary exponents of the type of occult philosophy in which both the Dee's were immersed.<ref> Peter French, John Dee, London RKP 1972, reprint 2013 </ref>}}Arthur Dee died in September or October 1651 and was buried in [[St George's Church, Tombland, Norwich]].

Weybourne Camp is north west of the coastal village of [[Weybourne, Norfolk|Weybourne]]. The site, originally called Carvel Farm,  was first used in 1935 by the Anti–Aircraft Division of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a summer training camp.<ref name="camphistory" /> In 1937 and as a result of the growing threat of war, it was decided to make the camp permanent and more fixed structures and defences were erected.During the Second World War, the camp was surrounded by a perimeter anti-tank ditch and defended by a system of gun emplacements and barbed wire. The interior of the camp consisted of groups of [[Nissen hut]]s, [[barracks]] and other military buildings. The cliff top to the north was covered by a line of heavy anti-aircraft guns and batteries, slit trenches and pillboxes. In 1941, the camp was visited by [[Winston Churchill]], to view a demonstration of the [[Unrotated Projectile]] anti–aircraft weapon.<ref name="camphistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.muckleburgh.co.uk/history.htm |title=The History of Muckleburgh|author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Muckleburgh Military Collection|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>As the war progressed, defences at Weybourne Camp became more complex and were altered regularly and significantly and a grass airstrip was laid out, which remains in use.After the war, the camp became known as the AA permanent Range and Radar Training Wing<ref name="camphistory" /> and gunnery training continued until 1958. The site still has a RAF radar receiving station and is the location of the University of East Anglia Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory and a Metrological Station.==The museum==When Weybourne Camp closed, the site returned to private ownership and many buildings that were beyond repair were demolished.<ref name="camphistory" />At the time of the museum's opening in 1988, the principal display consisted of 30 vehicles and a small room describing the camp history.<ref name="camphistory" /> The museum has expanded to include over 150 artillery pieces, tanks and other vehicles, most of which are in working order.The Muckleburgh Collection is home to The [[Suffolk Yeomanry|Suffolk]] and [[Norfolk Yeomanry]] collection,<ref>[[Suffolk Yeomanry#World War II]]</ref> the North Norfolk Amateur Radio Group<ref>[http://www.radioclubs.net/nnarg/ North Norfolk Amateur Radio Group]</ref> and numerous special displays.

(0	Bayaman Erkinbayev	<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Erkinbayev.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Bayaman Erkinbayev]] -->'''Bayaman Erkinbayev''' (Баяман Эркинбаев, c. 1967 - September 22, 2005) was a top [[Kyrgyzstan]]i [[lawmaker]] and [[parliament]]ary deputy, who was the driving force behind the riots in southern [[Kyrgyzstan]] that led to the overthrow of President [[Askar Akayev]] on March 24, 2005. One of the richest businessman in the country, he funded the [[Central Asia]]n state's [[Socialist Party (Kyrgyzstan)|Socialist Party]]. He had announced his candidacy for the [[presidency]] in the July 2005 elections, but bowed down long before the vote, when his party supported former security chief and [[Bishkek]] [[mayor]], [[Felix Kulov]].Starting out as a worker at a [[tobacco]] factory in his hometown of [[Osh]] in the south, Erkinbayev made his fame as a [[wrestler]], and served in [[parliament]] for a decade. He went on to own "Kara Suu", Central Asia’s largest [[bazaar]].Erkinbayev was a key figure behind the March 2005 events, where around 2,000 of his [[martial arts]] trainees moved across the southern cities of [[Jalal-Abad]], Osh, and [[Batken]], capturing government sites, burning down police stations, and blocking key highways. The protests later moved to the capital, Bishkek, and ousted longtime President [[Askar Akayev]] from office on March 24. Erkinbayev gained much support by financing protests, and sending in martial arts trainees to lead the demonstrations. He was a devotee of [[Alysh]], Kyrgyzstan’s answer to [[kung fu]] and was also the head of Kyrgyzstan's [[National Olympic Committee]][http://www.eurasianet.org/kyrgyzstan/timeline/timeline2.html].Erkinbayev was lauded as a hero in his hometown of Osh after the revolution, when some 20,000 people gathered in Osh’s main square to celebrate the regime’s fall. He was reported to exercise strong influence over small businesses in the Osh region, and was widely rumoured to be associated with the criminal world. Erkinbayev operated at the turbulent intersection where [[politics]], [[business]], [[sports]] and, sometimes, crime meet in post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Central Asia]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070924153244/http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/docs/Silkroadpapers/0610EMarat.pdf]. The Kyrgyz parliament, however, had refused [[prosecutor]]s' attempts to strip him of [[Parliamentary immunity|legal immunity]].Erkinbayev survived an [[assassination]] attempt on April 28, 2005, in which he was shot at from a car, and sported a bandage over his nose. He believed that the motive was political, but also felt that it could have been an attempt to wrestle control of his business empire. On September 22, 2005, however, Erkinbayev sustained bullet wounds to his neck and chest, when he was attacked by unidentified assailants from behind some bushes after arriving home by car late that day.

While these Six Religions of Vedic Culture initially had separate followers, theologian [[Adi Shankara]], the 8th century [[Common Era|CE]] [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosopher]], worked to join the adherents of the Six Religions into one through spreading his [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy.<ref>http://www.sringeri.net/history/sri-adi-shankaracharya/works-of-sri-adi-shankaracharya/stotras</ref> Adi Sankara's followers worship one divine power, [[Brahman]] in all its six manifestations. It centers around the worship of the Six of the supreme Deities of [[Hinduism|the Vedic Religion]], [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shakti]], [[Ganesha]], [[Surya]] and [[Murugan|Skanda]] as One. This is based on the belief in the essential oneness of all deities, the unity of Godhead, the one divine power, [[Brahman]].Philosophically, all are seen by [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitins]] as equal reflections of the one [[Saguna Brahman]], i.e., a personal God with form, rather than as distinct beings <ref>http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/lexicon/</ref>  [[Smartism]], a relatively modern Hindu tradition (compared to the three older traditions ), invites the worship of more than one god including Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Ganesha (the elephant god) and Surya (the sun god) among other gods and goddesses. It is not as overtly sectarian as either Vashnavism or Shaivism and is based on the recognition that Brahman (God) is the highest principle in the universe and pervades all of existence.<ref name=Iskcon>{{cite web|title=ISKCON Hinduism |url=http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1200.htm|accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="Hindus in SA">{{cite web|title=Hinduism in SA|url=http://www.hinduism.co.za/hindu3.htm|accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="Dubois">{{cite book|last=Dubois|title=Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies|publisher=Cosimo|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zMY2qURR-8C&pg=PA111&dq=hindu+sects&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MLD0UpvBNsLulAXmq4C4DA&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=hindu%20sects&f=false}}</ref> Generally Smartas worship the Supreme in one of six forms: Ganesha, Shiva, Sakti, Vishnu, Surya and Skanda.

It is believed that in Adi Shankara's time these deities had their own [[Hindu]] followers who quarrelled with each other claiming the superiority of their [[Iṣṭa-deva(tā)|chosen deity]]. Adi Shankara is said to have synthesised these quarrelling sects by integrating the worship of all these deities in the Shanmata system.==See also==*[[Ishta-Deva]]*[[Panchayatana puja]]*[[Smartism]]==Footnotes=={{Reflist}}[[Category:Worship in the Smarta Tradition]][[Category:Adi Shankara]])

Newborns measure 17–22&nbsp;cm (6.7-8.7 inches) in total length.<ref name="SB95"/> In Ashe's original 1968 description, adults were reported to grow to an average 49–68&nbsp;cm (about 19-27 inches) total length, with a head and body length of 43–59&nbsp;cm (about 17-23 inches) and a tail length of 6–9&nbsp;cm (2.4-3.5 inches).<ref name="Mal03"/>The eyes are set well forward in the head and are surrounded by 14-17 scales. [[Interorbital scales]] number 8-11. The eye is separated from the [[nasal scale|nasal]] by two to three scales and from the [[supralabials]] by two. [[Upper labials]]: 10-12. [[Sublabials]]: 11-14. The [[rostral scale]] is not as wide as it is long, while its upper margin is highest at the center. The rostral is also accompanied by an even number of suprarostrals. The superciliary scales above the eyes are not enlarged (as opposed to ''[[Atheris ceratophora|A. ceratophora]]''). The nasal scale is round and single, or partially divided.<ref name="Mal03"/>Midbody, the [[dorsal scale]] rows number 24-31. The dorsal scales are short and heavily keeled. However, on the upper dorsals the keels terminate before the end of each scale. On the lower dorsals, the keels are serrated (like in ''[[Echis]]''). The [[ventral scale]] count is 160-174. In females the [[subcaudals]] number 41-54. One male specimen had 53 subcaudals.<ref name="Mal03"/>The color pattern consists of a greenish-black to charcoal-black ground color, while each scale is tipped with yellow or yellowish-green, giving the animal a speckled appearance. Some scales have more of this color to them and form a series of loops along the sides of the body. These loops may fuse into zigzag patterns posteriorly, fading again on the tail. Anteriorly, the venter is yellow or yellowish, fading towards a purplish-black towards the rear and under the tail, except for the tip that is blotched with yellow. Juveniles are mainly yellow with a white tipped tail. This darkens as they grow until they reach the adult color phase at a total length of about {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="SB95"/><ref name="Mal03"/>==Geographic range==Two isolated populations in [[Kenya]]: in the forests at Chuka, south-eastern [[Mount Kenya]], and Igembe in the northern Nyambeni range.The [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] is listed as "near Chuka, Lat. 0° 20' S, Long. 37° 35' E, in rain forest at an altitude of c. 1600 meter [5,250 ft]", Kenya.<ref name="McD99"/>==Conservation status==Currently, this species is not listed on the [[IUCN]] Red List of Threatened Species nor in any of the [[CITES]] Appendices. In 2004, a proposal was submitted by [[Kenya]] to have it listed in CITES Appendix II on the grounds that the species has a very limited geographic range and suffers from rapid habitat loss. It is also threatened by illegal trade due to demand from reptile collectors in Europe and North America.<ref name="SSN">[http://www.ssn.org/Meetings/cop/cop13/Factsheets/SSNCOP13_snakes_EN.pdf CoP13] at [http://www.ssn.org/ Species Survival Network]. Accessed 8 October 2006.</ref> Apparently this proposal was not accepted. The Commission of European Communities considered the arguments weak, saying that they did not demonstrate significant trade, and that the species is already protected in Kenya. They suggested Appendix III instead.<ref name="CEC">Commission of European Communities. 2004.

Accessed 9 October 2006.</ref>==Habitat==The original specimens, for which field notes were taken, were found in dense [[rain forest]] at 1,600 m (5,250&nbsp;ft), collected in clearings and along pathways in the dense foliage about 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft) above the ground. The conditions were very humid and all specimens were collected within a 1.6&nbsp;km (1 mile) radius.<ref name="Mal03"/> In this environment, their coloration offers them an excellent camouflage, making them very difficult to spot.<ref name="SB95"/>==Behavior==Little is known. They are obviously [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]], moving slowly and deliberately among the branches of their habitat as other ''[[Atheris]]'' species do, but it is unknown when their daily peak activity occurs.<ref name="SB95"/> In captivity, they are just as willing to accept food during the day as at night.<ref name="Mal03"/>When captured, they will strike readily and struggle vigorously in the hand. They may also perform a characteristic, [[stridulation|stridulating]] threat display, in which counterlooped coils and the lower serrated, keeled scales are rubbed against one another to produce a loud hissing noise. However, captive specimens soon calm down and this behavior is lost.<ref name="Mal03"/>==Feeding==Reported to be an opportunist, [[Predation|preying]] on [[amphibian]]s, [[rodent]]s and small [[bird]]s.<ref name="Mal03"/>==Reproduction==A gravid female specimen found in the Nyambeni range is reported to have given birth to 13 offspring in the month of August. Newborns measured 17–21&nbsp;cm (6.7-8.3 inches) in total length.<ref name="SB95"/>==Venom==The Kenyan who collected the first specimens was bitten by an adult, with a single [[fang]] penetrating his right index finger. There was significant swelling and pain. A [[tourniquet]] was applied and an unknown [[antivenin]] was administered, after which the patient made a full recovery. It is doubtful, however, that the antivenin made any difference in this case, for no antivenin is known to be effective. Nevertheless, since these snakes are relatively large (for ''Atheris'') and their venom is known to contain powerful [[anticoagulant]]s, a bite should be taken seriously. Poor [[coagulation]] may even require [[blood transfusion]]s.<ref name="SB95"/><ref name="Mal03"/>==See also==* [[List of viperine species and subspecies]]* {{c|Viperinae by common name}}* {{c|Viperinae by taxonomic synonyms}}* [[Snakebite]]==References=={{reflist}}==Further reading=={{refbegin}}* Ashe J. 1968.

(0	Music history of Barbados	The [[music of Barbados]] draws on the island's cultural heritage, and the '''music history of Barbados''' reflects the island's diverse cultures.== Early history ==While slavery was ongoing (1627–1838) in Barbados, African music included [[work song]]s, [[funeral|funereal]] and [[religious music]].  Though slave owners initially allowed dances, this ended in 1688 out of fear that the slaves might plan a rebellion at such festivities.  The same 1630 law also prohibited the use of drums and horns, which were feared might be used as communication to facilitate slave rebellions. The elite plantocracy of the island during the colonial era felt that Christianity was ill-suited for slaves; instead, the [[Church of England]] sent missionaries to convert the slave population.  Any cultural element of apparent African origin was suppressed in the name of promoting Christianity.  Legal restrictions furthered this goal by banning parties on Sundays, the Christian day of rest, as well as dances like the outdoors fertility dance, ''Jean and Johnnie''.<ref name="Garland">{{cite book|author     = Millington, Janice|isbn         = 0-8153-1865-0|chapter    = Barbados|pages      = 813–821|publisher  = Routledge|title      = Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Vol. 2|year       = 1999}}</ref>Traditional African music continued in spite of legal restrictions, including the use of drums and rattles, and declamatory and improvised [[call and response (music)|call and response]] vocals.  Much African music was used in [[Obeah]], an African religion found throughout the island.  By the beginning of the 19th century, slaves provided most of the musical accompaniment for plantation festivities, such as the [[Crop Over|Harvest Home]], while the white elites participated in [[dignity ball]]s.== 19th century ==With the slave population approaching three times the white population, many slave owners feared revolts.  This led to the [[Slave Consolidation Act]] in 1826, which reaffirmed the ban on drums and horns.  Christian missionaries also discouraged the performance of African music, which pushed the field underground, where it was passed through secret societies and rituals.  Slavery in Barbados was finally ended in 1838, and newly emancipated blacks celebrated with instruments including drums and horns, as well as [[banjo]]s, [[tambourine]]s and [[xylophone]]s.  Still, however, the use of horns and drums was discouraged, leading to the primacy of vocal music; at the same time, new Protestant churches from North American moved into the island, bringing with them American [[parlor music]], cowboy songs and revivalist [[hymn]]s.Following emancipation, ensembles consisting of snare and bass drums, flute and triangle emerged; these were called [[tuk band]]s, and may have been based on British [[Fife (musical instrument)|fife]]-and-drum corps.  They used African [[polyrhythm]]s and [[syncopation]], and accompanied the community dance troupe [[Landship (Barbados)|Landship]], which simulated the movement of ships at sea through dance, as well as at various kinds of celebrations and festivals.  In 1889, the [[Royal Barbados Police Band]] formed.  This instrumental ensemble remains popular, and has performed across the world.== 20th century ==Early in the 20th century, [[calypso music]] arrived from Trinidad.  Without many local fans, only a few Barbadian calypsonians arose, including [[Da Costa Allamby]] and [[Mighty Charmer]].  Beginning in about the 1940s, when the [[crop over]] festival was cancelled due to the decline of the sugarcane industry, Barbados has seen the influx of popular music from other countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Jamaica and Cuba.<ref name="Ledesma">{{cite book|author     = De Ledesma, Charles|chapter    = Put Water in the Brandy?|author2=Georgia Popplewell|editors     = Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.)|isbn         = 1-85828-636-0|title      = Rough Guide to World Music, Vol. 2: Latin & North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific|pages      = 507–526|publisher  = Rough Guides|year       = 2000}}</ref>Following independence in 1966, Barbadian calypso became more popular, especially the band [[The Merrymen]], known for songs like "Brudda Neddy" and "Millie Gone to Brazil".  [[Jackie Opel]], a Barbadian singer, also arose, playing a blend of calypso and reggae that evolved into [[spouge]] music.  Spouge was immensely popular in Barbados from about 1969 to 1973.  In 1974, the Crop Over Festival was revived, featuring calypso competitions; as a result, calypso's popularity grew, rapidly overshadowing spouge and other genres, with only [[dub music]] achieving equal stature.<ref name="Barbados.org">[http://www.barbados.org/music/calypso.htm Barbados Music: Calypso]</ref>== Bibliography =={{cite web|accessdate = June 6, 2006|title      = Independence Day Military Parades|url        = http://www.allinfoaboutbarbados.com/Independence_Day_Military_Parade.html|work       = All Info About Barbados}}* {{cite web|accessdate = June 6, 2006|title      = Tuk band|url        = http://www.allinfoaboutbarbados.com/The_Tuk_Band.html|work       = All Info About Barbados}}* {{cite web|accessdate = June 6, 2006|title      = The Barbados Landship|url        = http://www.allinfoaboutbarbados.com/The_Barbados_Landship.html|work       = All Info About Barbados}}* {{cite book|author     = Louise Nevelson|isbn         = 0-8442-4907-6|publisher  = Passport Books|title      = Caribbean Islands Handbook with the Bahamas|year       = 1996}}* {{cite web|accessdate = December 3, 2005|publisher  = Barbados.org|title      = Calypso|url        = http://www.barbados.org/music/calypso.htm|work       = Barbados Music}}* {{cite journal|author     = Pinckney, Warren R.

Along with [[Pulau Pawai]] and [[Pulau Sudong]], it is used as a [[military education and training|military training]] area for [[live-fire exercise]]s. Pulau Senang is best known in the [[history of Singapore]] as a [[penal colony|penal settlement]] experiment that failed after only three years, when a [[riot]] against the guards broke out in 1963, killing three officers.==Etymology=='''''Pulau Senang''''' is [[Malay language|Malay]] for "island of ease".==History==Pulau Senang was a penal experiment where [[prison]]ers were allowed to roam freely on the island. It was thought that detainees could be [[rehabilitation (penology)|reformed]] through [[manual labour]].The settlement started on 18 May 1960, when 50 detainees arrived with [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] [[Daniel Dutton (superintendent)|Daniel Dutton]]. Over the next three years, the number of detainees rose to 320, and they transformed the island into an attractive settlement.Believing that through hard work, the detainees could be reformed, Dutton  removed [[weapon|arms]] from the guards. On 12 July 1963, a group of some 70 to 90 detainees rioted and burned down most of the buildings. They hacked Dutton to death and killed two other officers. 58 people were [[Criminal accusation|accused]] of rioting and [[murder]]ing Dutton and officers Arumugan Veerasingham and Tan Kok Hian.Because of the large number of the accused, a special [[courtroom|dock]] had to be constructed for them. The [[Legal case|case]] went to [[Trial (law)|trial]] on 18 November and lasted an unprecedented 64 days. On 12 March 1964, the seven-member [[jury]] found 18 of the accused [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of murder, 18 guilty of rioting with deadly weapons and 11 guilty of rioting. The remaining 11 accused were [[acquittal|acquitted]]. Those found guilty of murder were [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], while those found guilty of rioting with deadly weapons were [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]d to three years of [[imprisonment]]; the rest to two years of imprisonment.Most of those involved in the rioting were members of [[Secret societies in Singapore|secret societies]] who were detained without trial and had no hope of leaving the island. As a result of the riots, the penal experiment came to an abrupt end.==Restricted area==From 1986, the island together with [[Pulau Sudong]] and [[Pulau Pawai]], these three islands formed the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] Southern Islands Live Firing Area.<ref>[https://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/press_room/official_releases/nr/1998/oct/08oct98_nr.html Live explosive being tested on civilian structure in the Southern islands live-firing area.]</ref> RSAF is also conducting military exercises and they also have a runway for planes to fly and attack along [[Pulau Sudong]] and [[Pulau Pawai]], it is a restricted area when live firing takes place.<ref>[https://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/press_room/events_and_activities/2016/03nov16_activity%20.html#.WFvD-bZ97dS Typical MINDEF notice during live-firing ex]</ref>==Panorama=={{wide image|Western Islands, panorama, Nov 06.jpg|800px|The Southern Islands, [[Singapore]].

The Board of Trustees established the School of Business Administration in 1947, and within seven years, it was conferring graduate degrees, including doctorates after 1967. The school was accredited at the undergraduate level by the [[AACSB|Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] in May 1958, and in March 1959, the Board of Trustees authorized the establishment of four academic departments within the school: Accounting, General Business and Finance, Management, and Marketing. In September 1967, a program leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration was introduced.In 1964, the school moved to its current building in the heart of the UMass Amherst campus. In 1983, the School of Business Administration changed its name to School of Management. The Isenberg School of Management was named after Eugene Isenberg in 1998.<ref name="Isenberg name direction">{{cite web|title=UMass business school gets new name, direction|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/1999/01/04/story4.html|publisher=[[Boston Business Journal]]|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref> Gene was [[Chairman]]  and CEO of [[Nabors Industries]]<ref name="Isenberg Nabors">{{cite web|title=A Very Rich Adieu for Nabors CEO|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204528204577007932167790556|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref> at the time, a world leader in gas and petroleum drilling.

(0	Portal:Messianic Judaism/Intro	[[File:Messianic symbol.svg|right|95px|Seal of Messianic Judaism]]'''[[Messianic Judaism]]''' is a [[syncretic]] [[religion|religious movement]] that arose in the 1960s. It incorporates elements of Judaism with the [[Christianity#Beliefs|tenets of Christianity]].Messianic Judaism states that [[Jesus]] is not merely a man, but the [[Jewish Messiah]] and "[[God the Son]]" (one [[Hypostasis (religion)|person]] of the [[Trinity]]), and that [[Salvation#Christianity|salvation]] is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Much like [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]], Messianic Judaism rejects the idea of binding [[halakha|Jewish law]]. Any Jewish customs that are followed are cultural and do only contribute to attaining sanctification, not salvation. Belief in the messiahship and divinity of Jesus, which Messianic Judaism shares, is viewed by [[Christian denomination]]s and [[Jewish religious movements]] as being a defining distinction between [[Christianity]] and Judaism.Some members of the movement are ethnically Jewish, and some of them argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism. Jewish organizations and religious movements reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect. The Supreme Court of Israel has ruled that the [[Law of Return]] should treat Jews who convert to Messianic Judaism the same way it treats Jews who convert to Christianity. Mainstream Christian groups generally accept Messianic Judaism as a form of Christianity.From 2003 to 2007, the movement grew from 150 Messianic houses of worship in the United States to as many as 438, with over 100 in Israel and more worldwide; often congregations are members of larger Messianic organizations or alliances.)

Flores was the first [[Mexican American]] to become a [[bishop]] of the [[Catholic Church]].==Early life==Flores was born in 1929 to Patrico and Trinidad Fernandez de Flores, American [[migrant worker]]s, in [[Ganado, Texas|Ganado]], Texas.  In the tenth grade he considered dropping out of school after his father had become ill, but  he was persuaded to stay after a bishop agreed to finance his education.  He worked as a [[janitor]] at a local cantina and decided to make the world a cleaner and more habitable place by becoming a [[priest]].He graduated from Catholic Kirwin High School (now [[O'Connell Consolidated High School]]) in [[Galveston, Texas]].  He studied at St. Mary's Seminary in [[La Porte, Texas]] and at St. Mary's Seminary in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].  He received his divinity degree and was ordained a priest on May 26, 1956 by bishop [[Wendelin Joseph Nold]] in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]].  He then served as a parish priest in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston|Diocese of Galveston-Houston]].In the early 1960s, he directed the [[Christian Family Movement]] in the Galveston-Houston diocese and the Bishop's Committee for the Spanish Speaking, a ministry that encouraged bilingual congregations. Later, in October 1969, Flores joined forty-seven other Hispanic priests to establish [[PADRES]] ''Padres Asociados para Derechos Religiosos, Educativos, y Sociales'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Priests Associated for Religious, Education, and Social Rights"), an organization meant to draw attention to the problems of Hispanics in the church and society.==As bishop and archbishop==On May 5, 1970 he was consecrated a bishop by Archbishop [[Luigi Raimondi]].  He was appointed auxiliary to the archbishop of San Antonio.  Also in May 1970, Flores was appointed chairman of the Texas State Advisory Committee to the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]], and that July he became national chaplain for the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]].  In 1972, he was co-founder and honorary chairman of the [[Mexican-American Cultural Center]] in San Antonio.In 1978 he was appointed bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of El Paso]] and then in 1979 the Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio]], which was, at the time, the largest [[ecclesiastical province]] in the United States.In 1980, Flores became a member of the Hispanic Caucus Committee, and in 1981, he founded [[Catholic Television of San Antonio]], the first diocesan television station in the United States.  In 1997, when [[Billy Graham]] headlined a religious crusade at the [[Alamodome]], Flores taped radio spots in English and Spanish to promote the event. Graham later credited Flores for the large response from the area's largely Catholic Hispanic community.Flores' suit against the city of [[Boerne, Texas]] in his bid to expand St. Peter's Church there led to the landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), which struck down certain provisions of the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] of 1993 as unconstitutionally exceeding the powers granted to the [[United States Congress|Congress]] under Section Five of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].After reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Flores retired from his position on December 29, 2004 and became Archbishop [[emeritus]].His motto was ''Laborabo non mihi sed omnibus'', "I will work not for myself but for others".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/specials/religion/archbishop_flores/|title=Archbishop Patrick Flores|format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114031117/http://www.mysanantonio.com/specials/religion/archbishop_flores/ |archivedate=January 14, 2006 }}</ref>==June 2000 hostage situation==On June 27, 2000, Nelson Antonio Escolero, a native of [[El Salvador]] and a legal U.S. resident, held Flores hostage for over nine hours in his office in the Catholic Chancery.  Escolero had been arrested for driving with a suspended license and feared that he would be deported.  Armed with a fake grenade, he also held the archbishop's secretary  Myrtle Sanchez for the first two hours of the stand-off.  Police hostage negotiators had been in contact with Escolero throughout the day, but were taken by surprise when he released Flores and surrendered in the evening.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Holley |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Thank God!; Archbishop freed unharmed after 9 hours |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/religion/stories/MYSA062900.flores.74a4a2f6.html |work= |publisher=Express-News |date=June 29, 2000 |accessdate=October 21, 2007 }}</ref>==Film==On October 6, 2007, ''A Migrant's Masterpiece'' an hour-long documentary depicting Flores' life premiered in San Antonio.

First two sections are a [[WP:NOT#GUIDE|game guide]], nothing more; and the "official matches" bit is only supported by Valve's site and the devs' - neither of which are independent.  Perhaps that section could be merged; as it stands there's no notability outside a narrow gaming community.

A PC gamer magazine (One of the more well known publications relating to PC games I believe) article covered HL2:CTF in their July 2005 issue, as well as the first Valve match (I have since made a correction to that section based upon the article). Once I am sure about policies on quotes, fair use of article sections and such, I can add more from the article. Any links are appreciated. PC Gamer is an independent magazine, and Valve involves far more than a "narrow gaming community" with a little research into counterstrike, team fortress 2, and the like, you will see a very broad sampling of people and organizations including cyber gaming leagues and the like. Other articles will cover that better. As for this entry, the PC gamer article further establishes credibility from a completely independent and respected source.[[User:Palehorse864|Palehorse864]] ([[User talk:Palehorse864|talk]]) 08:41, 24 January 2008 (UTC)* <span style="font-size: smaller;">Note: This debate has been added to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games/Deletion|list of video game deletions]]. [[User:Someone another|Someone]][[User_talk:Someone another|another]] 20:40, 24 January 2008 (UTC)</span>* '''Keep''' - the source for the valve match is PC Gamer, and assuming it isn't being cited inappropriately, that's a reliable source and establishes the subject's notability.  The article wasn't nominated for failing [[WP:V]], and since the subject itself is verifiable, any content that Gavin Collins wishes to challenge should be done ''on the article's talk page,'' to give the editors a reasonable opportunity to fix the problem as set forth in that policy.  AfD only provides five days, which may not be enough time for editors who only have an hour or two per day to devote to Wikipedia, let alone to a single article on Wikipedia.  [[WP:NOT#GUIDE]] applies to  each article as a whole, not necessarily to sections of it - the two descriptive sections are not extensive, and so shouldn't cause concern.  Applying WP's policies too rigidly is just being [[Anal retentive|anally retentive]].  For example, if [[WP:V]] were applied vigorously by everybody, we wouldn't even have an article on [[Luke Skywalker]]. :)  And 95% of Wikipedia would disappear.

Without multiple independent sources there's never going to be a proper reception section, which is vital in almost all video game articles. No good sources are coming up in a search, though I'm having difficulty connecting to the mod's site for some reason. I'll take another look, but PC gamer alone doesn't cut it. [[User:Someone another|Someone]][[User_talk:Someone another|another]] 15:09, 30 January 2008 (UTC)*'''Comment on above''' There is a bit more, but I haven't managed to get around to revising the article due to a heavy load of college school work and deadlines coming down during this time period.  I have found sources that worked for other mods and games to gain notability and am looking toward adding these.  I think the Valve match (Which would be notable if it were only for an established and respected game company hacking a mod to give themselves powers that don't exist within the game. A developer hacking their team's advantage into an official match (For fun mind you) may be a first in the video gaming world, considering there haven't been that many developer matches.  <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/76.111.205.13|76.111.205.13]] ([[User talk:76.111.205.13|talk]]) 01:19, 31 January 2008 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:UnsignedIP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->:If you're confident that the sources you have can pass notability then keeping the article for now and allowing sufficient time for you to get to it seems only fair. Changed accordingly. Valve's stunt is certainly worth covering, but the guts of game articles are 'gameplay', 'reception' and 'development'. At the very least a crisp gameplay section and a reception section with at least two separate views, along with [[WP:RS|reliable]] sources, are enough to sustain an article. If other editors agree that [http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLMotw.Detail&id=23 Planet Half-life's review] (this one in particular), [http://www.moddb.com/features/23744/half-life-2-capture-the-flag Mod Database review] and/or [http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/article_76/ Half-Life Fallout review] could pass as reliable sources then I'd have no problem with it whatsoever - coupled with the PC Gamer review that'd make a reception section.

Not even close to [[WP:PROF]] and, as for [[WP:BIO]], we have a little press about his discovery of a Mersenne prime but almost nothing else. I searched hard for sources a week ago (before I did, the article had basically the same content but was totally unsourced) and could find almost nothing about him to add to the article. As discussed above, I think this falls under [[WP:BIO1E]]: his discovery of the prime is a notable event that is already covered under [[Mersenne prime]], his work with [[GIMPS]] does not really add notability to the article, and I've already included the only other interesting and verifiable factoid (his coinage of the GIMPS name) to the GIMPS article. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 16:50, 2 September 2009 (UTC)*'''Delete'''. I was thinking of suggesting a merge to [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]], but the merge-worthy info is already there.

Nowadays the search for Mersenne primes has been automated by GIMPs to the point where I think that the notability of any individual discovery has been diminished, but his discovery was prior to that period and has more of the flavor of an individual wildcatter striking black gold. There are plenty of reliable sources about the discovery and I think it does have long-term significance. But to me, passing the bar at BIO1E is less about the size of the 1E itself and more about whether there is anything to say about the subject that is not more directly about the 1E. In this case, there doesn't seem to be much to say about Welsh other than his discovery. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 23:46, 2 September 2009 (UTC):''The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the debate.  <span style="color:red">'''Please do not modify it.'''</span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]]).

In that same decade they added an [[Pipe organ|organ]], did away with the [[Tallit|prayer shawl]], and started a [[Hebrew school|religious school]]. In the 1870s the congregation removed [[yahrzeit candle]]s from the sanctuary, and added [[Mechitza|family pews]] and a [[Tzniut#Female singing voice|mixed choir]] (men and women together).

Oakwood was a "restricted community"; Jews were not allowed to reside or own stores there. According to Leonard Spialter, president of the Dayton Jewish Genealogical Society, "if you were dead, you could be buried in Oakwood, but if you were alive, you couldn’t live there". Relatives began moving those buried at the Rubicon cemetery to the new "Riverview Cemetery", including Lebensburger, who had died by this time. This process was not completed until 1967.<ref name=Tedford2009/>In its first forty years the congregation had a series of generally short-tenured religious leaders. These included Delbanco (1862–63), Moses Bauer (1863–64), L. Liebman (1864–67), Abraham Blum (1868–69), Leon Leopold (1870–72), Ben Weil (1872–76), Ephraim Fischer (1876–81), Godfrey/Gottheil Taubenhaus (later rabbi of [[Congregation Beth Elohim (Brooklyn, New York)|Congregation Beth Elohim]] of [[Brooklyn, New York]]) (1881–85), and Israel Saenger (1885–89).<ref name=Landman1941v3p493/>During this period the membership also transformed from immigrant-born to native-born. In 1881 the congregation's "language of record" was changed from German to English, and in 1889 the synagogue hired its first American-trained [[rabbi]], Max Wertheimer.<ref name=Olitzky1996p293/>A graduate of Wise's [[Hebrew Union College]], Wertheimer had been born in Germany to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] parents.

In his view, Christians were now more liberal and celebrated "the inherent humanness and [[universalism]]" of Christmas, rather than any specifically Christian doctrine. Stating that his children had been deprived of the holiday's pleasures, Witt asserted that [[Judaism]] was already a syncretic religion, and that celebrating the holiday was an ecumenical act which did not indicate that he was "thereby drawn even by the breadth of a hair nearer to the worship of an ecclesiastical [[Christ]]". He concluded by asking "Is it neither treason of Jew nor triumph of Christian but partnership of Jew and Christian in the making of a better world in which the Christ can have part only by energizing and perpetuating and hallowing the partnership?"<ref>See [[#refTime1940|TIME (1940)]], [[#refSarna1990|Sarna (1990)]], p. 158, [[#refRestad1996|Restad (1996)]], pp. 158–159, [[#refShandler2009|Shandler (2009)]], pp. 198–199.</ref>During Witt's tenure, Dayton experienced an influx of Jewish immigration, and the original German-Jewish constituency of the congregation became more diverse.

He worked at a number of non-rabbinic jobs (including as an [[Ordinary Seaman]] in the [[United States Merchant Marine|U.S. Merchant Marine]]), and several rabbinic positions, including both pulpit and non-pulpit roles. In 1939 he was appointed Director of Youth Education for the UAHC, and also became the first director of the National Federation of Temple Youth (now [[North American Federation of Temple Youth]]).<ref name=AJArchives460>[[#refAJArchives460|An Inventory to the Selwyn D.

His vision was realized in 1994, when the congregation moved to a new building on Riverside Drive, near downtown Dayton. The building at Salem and Emerson was sold to a Baptist church. As noted by Bloom, the congregation had "come full circle"; it purchased its first building from a Baptist church in downtown Dayton, and had sold its most recent building to a Baptist church in order to return to the area.<ref name=Thum2000/> By 1995, however, membership was only eight hundred families.<ref name=Olitzky1996p293/>Bloom retired in 1997, and was succeeded by Marc Gruber.<ref name=History/> A graduate of [[Brandeis University]], Gruber attended Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem and New York, and was ordained in 1981.

The yellowish-white, conical shell is moderately depressed and slightly convex below. It has a very strong, rounded keel, and is widely umbilicate. The [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] consists of 6½ [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s. The nucleus is smooth. The upper whorls contain concentric ribs and traces of one or two spiral lirae, producing small tubercles on the ribs. The whorls are flattened near the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]]. Above the upper row of tubercles, this depression is roughened by small lamellae. The lower part of the whorls is slightly convex. On the lower whorls, the sculptureconsists of a row of rather strong tubercles At some distance from the suture, the flattened space between suture and tubercles is also lamelliferous. A second row of smaller tubercles makes its appearance, and becomes more conspicuous on the [[body whorl]]. At some distance from the lower suture, a spiral rib, with inconspicuous beads, is crossed by irregular, waved lamellae, which spread on the large keel. This keel is flat above, rounded at its periphery, and adorned by sharp, compressed folds, which make it crenulated. The base of the shell is sculptured by five beaded spirals, of which the outer one, placed at some distance from the margin, and the most central one, bordering the umbilicus are double. The whole base is covered by radiating very oblique riblets. The funnel-shaped [[Umbilicus (mollusc)|umbilicus]] is pervious. It has two spiral lirae, of which the lower one is beaded, and radiating riblike striae. Its largest diameter is about 1⅓ of the base. The [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] is rhombic. The convex,outer margin is rather thin, internally lirate, with short folds between the lirae. The convex basal margin is short,  and internally with a few lirae. The broad [[Columella (gastropod)|columella]] is concave, with a conspicuous fold near the base and a small denticle above it. Itsupper part is connected to the outer margin by a conspicuous layer of enamel, with thickened margin, and a free ear-shaped projection, covering part of the umbilicus. <ref> [https://archive.org/details/sibogaexpeditie39sibo Schepman M.M.

(0	Du Hong	{{more footnotes|date=December 2013}}'''Du Hong''' (杜洪) (d. 905) was a warlord late in the [[History of China|Chinese]] dynasty [[Tang Dynasty]], who controlled Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern [[Wuhan]], [[Hubei]]) from 886 to 905.  In 905, he was defeated and captured by [[Yang Xingmi]], who executed him.==Background and seizure of Wuchang Circuit==It is not known when Du Hong was born, but it is known that he was from Wuchang's capital E Prefecture (鄂州) and that, in his youth, he was an actor.  Late in the ''Qianfu'' era (874-879) of [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Emperor Xizong]], when much of the realm was overrun by agrarian rebels, E's prefect Cui Shao (崔紹) organized the people into local militias to defend against attacks, so the prefectural militia became a strong fighting force.  It was during this time that Du became an officer in the prefectural militia.<ref name=NBT190>''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:新唐書/卷190|vol. 190]].</ref>In 884, Cui died.  The imperial official Lu Shenzhong (路審中), whom the imperial government had commissioned the prefect of Hang Prefecture (杭州, in modern [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]]), had been refused entry by the warlord [[Qian Liu]], who occupied the region; he therefore took up residence at Wuchang's Huang Prefecture (黃州, in modern Wuhan).  Upon hearing news of Cui's death, he conscripted 3,000 soldiers and entered E Prefecture, taking it over.  Thereafter, Du expelled the prefect of Yue Prefecture (岳州, in modern [[Yueyang]], [[Hunan]]) and took it over himself, claiming the title of prefect.<ref name=ZZTJ255>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷255|vol. 255]].</ref>In 886, the agrarian rebel Zhou Tong (周通) attacked E Prefecture.  Lu abandoned E and fled.  Du took the chance to enter E and claimed the title of acting military governor of Wuchang, a title that Emperor Xizong thereafter confirmed.<ref name=ZZTJ256>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷256|vol. 256]].</ref>==Rule of Wuchang Circuit==It was said that while Du Hong received the commission from the imperial government, he became an ally of the warlord [[Zhu Wen|Zhu Quanzhong]] the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern [[Kaifeng]], [[Henan]]) and cut off the tribute routes between the southeastern circuits not allied with Zhu and the imperial capital [[Chang'an]].<ref name=NBT190/>In 894, Wu Tao (吳討) the prefect of Huang Prefecture submitted to a chief rival of Zhu's, [[Yang Xingmi]] the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).  In response, Du attacked Wu, and Wu, while Yang sent his brother-in-law [[Zhu Yanshou]] to aid Wu, was still fearful of Du's attack, and therefore surrendered his post completely to Yang.  Yang sent his officer Qu Zhang (瞿章) to take over Huang Prefecture and defend against Du.<ref name=ZZTJ259>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷259|vol. 259]].</ref>Fearing Yang's expansion, in 896, Du, along with Qian Liu (then the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, headquartered at Hang Prefecture)) and [[Zhong Chuan]] the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (鎮南, headquartered in modern [[Nanchong]], [[Jiangxi]]), all sought aid from Zhu Quanzhong.  Zhu Quanzhong sent his adoptive son Zhu Yougong (朱友恭) south to try to determine what he could do, but Zhu Yougong appeared to not venture far.<ref name=ZZTJ260>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷260|vol. 260]].</ref>In 897, under order by Emperor Xizong's brother and successor [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang|Emperor Zhaozong]], Yang attacked Du, and Du sought aid from Zhu Quanzhong.  Zhu Quanzhong sent Nie Jin (聶金) to raid Huainan's Si Prefecture (泗州, in modern [[Huai'an]], [[Jiangsu]]) and sent Zhu Yougong to attack Huang Prefecture.  Qu abandoned Huang and took his army and people south to Wuchang Base (武昌寨, in modern [[Ezhou]], [[Hubei]]).  Zhu Yougong subsequently captured Wuchang Base, took Qu captive, and captured Huang Prefecture.  The Huainan forces that Yang sent to aid Qu were all repelled.  A subsequent major attack by Zhu Quanzhong on Huainan was decisively repelled by Yang and his general [[Zhu Jin]], however, and it was said that thereafter Zhu no longer had the strength to consider a major attack on Huainan.<ref name=ZZTJ261>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷261|vol. 261]].</ref>In 903, Yang sent his officer [[Li Shenfu]], with Liu Cun (劉存) as Li's deputy, to again attack Du.  Li first attack E Prefecture's Yongxing County (永興, in modern [[Huanggang]], [[Hubei]]) and captured it.<ref name=ZZTJ263>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷263|vol. 263]].</ref>  He then put E Prefecture under siege, and Du sought aid from Zhu Quanzhong.  Zhu sent his officer Han Qing (韓勍) with 10,000 men to Shekou (灄口, in modern Wuhan), and also sent messengers to [[Cheng Rui]] the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern [[Jingzhou]], [[Hubei]]), [[Ma Yin]] the military governor of Wu'an Circuit (武安, headquartered in modern [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]]), and [[Lei Yanwei]] the military governor of Wuzhen Circuit (武貞, headquartered in modern [[Changde]], [[Hunan]]), trying to persuade them to save Du.  Cheng, who feared Zhu's strength and also wanted to expand his own territory, launched a fleet to try to save Du, but after he left his capital Jing Prefecture (荊州), Ma and Lei jointly attacked Jing Prefecture, capturing it and pillaging its wealth and population.  Hearing the news, the morale of Cheng's soldiers failed, and Li subsequently engaged him and decisively defeated him.  Cheng committed suicide by drowning, and Han withdrew, leaving Du with no aid.  Du was only subsequently saved when Li was also forced to withdraw when Yang's subordinates [[Tian Jun]] the military governor of Ningguo Circuit (寧國, headquartered in modern [[Xuancheng]], [[Anhui]]) and An Renyi (安仁義) the military prefect of Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]]) rebelled against Yang, requiring Li to engage Tian instead.<ref name=ZZTJ264>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷264|vol. 264]].</ref>==Defeat and death==In 904, with Yang Xingmi's having crushed Tian Jun's rebellion, he again sent Li Shenfu to attack Wuchang.  Zhu Quanzhong, who had then seized control of Emperor Zhaozong and forcibly moved the capital and the emperor from Chang'an to [[Luoyang]], sent messengers to Yang, seeking to intercede on Du Hong's behalf, and Yang responded, "I will do so and rebuild my relationship with you if the Son of Heaven were restored to Chang'an."<ref name=ZZTJ264/>  Later in 904, when Li fell ill (and later died), Yang sent Liu Cun to replace Li and continued the siege.  In spring 905, Zhu sent Cao Yanzuo (曹延祚) to help Du defend the city, but Liu soon captured the city and took Du and Cao captive, delivering them to Yang Xingmi at Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (揚州).<ref name=ZZTJ265>''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷265|vol. 265]].</ref>  When Yang questioned Du why he did not surrender, Du responded, "I could not betray Lord Zhu."  Yang then executed him and Cao.  After Zhu usurped the Tang throne and established [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] as its emperor, he posthumously honored Du.<ref name=NBT190/>==Notes and references=={{reflist}}* ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:新唐書/卷190|vol. 190]].* ''[[Old History of the Five Dynasties|History of the Five Dynasties]]'', [[:zh:s:舊五代史/卷17|vol. 17]].* ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷255|255]], [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷256|256]], [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷259|259]], [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷260|260]], [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷261|261]], [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷263|263]], [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷264|264]], [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷265|265]].{{DEFAULTSORT:Du Hong}}[[Category:9th-century births]][[Category:905 deaths]][[Category:Politicians from Wuhan]][[Category:Tang dynasty jiedushi of Wuchang Circuit]][[Category:Executed Tang dynasty people]][[Category:Executed people from Hubei]][[Category:Executed military personnel]][[Category:People executed by the Tang dynasty by decapitation]][[Category:10th-century executions]][[Category:Tang dynasty generals from Hubei]][[Category:Male actors from Wuhan]][[Category:Tang dynasty politicians from Hubei]])

Her last wish was to donate a kidney to her dear friend Susan Delfino. Beth and Susan weren't really friends. That's probably why a grieving Paul tells his former neighbor that there's no way she's going to strip his wife for spare parts. Mike wants to fight this thing. The law is on their side. But that doesn't matter to Susan. She barely acknowledged Beth in life, so why should she deserve anything from her in death?Paul swings by the prison where Felicia tells him they need to stop hurling hatred at each other. She wants Beth taken off life support so she can rest. Later, Paul lets Susan know that he's alerted the transplant office to move forward with Beth's wishes. When he breaks down in tears, Susan gives him a hug. One can only suspect things will only get worse for Paul once he learns Felicia Tilman is being released from prison.Tom gets a great new job offer, but declines the deal out of loyalty to Carlos. This has Lynette scheming for ways to get him to reconsider. She performs a little bedroom seduction that's typically reserved for corporate hotshots. As sexy as this scene is, Tom won't be swayed. He tells her he will ask Carlos to match the offer, which he doesn't.Lynette swings by the local car dealership to borrow a $70,000 sports car. She parks that it in Carlos' driveway so that Tom can see that his boss certainly can afford to pay him better. The plan works. Tom accepts the new job, but wants to renege once he learns what his wife did. A test drive in the sports car has Tom reconsidering his position.Bree receives a call from Karen McCluskey in the early hours of the morning, telling her that Andrew was on her couch, passed out. Bree goes over to the house with Alex and they collect Andrew. They take him home, and then she and Alex talk about Andrew's problem. Alex mentions that he is thinking of leaving Andrew because of the seriousness of the problem, but Bree pleads with him not to if she could help him.Bree then secretly takes Andrew to an AA meeting (which he was not happy about). When it came to Andrew's turn to talk he instead started to criticize his mother and he mentions some of the bad things she has done throughout his life.Later on at Andrew's house, Bree asks Andrew to come back to another meeting, but he insists that he doesn't have a problem and that he is fine. Bree accepts this at first and leaves but then remembers about Beth and her pain, so she goes back inside and begs Andrew to discuss his problems. Andrew gets emotional as he tells her that Alex had left him due to his addiction. Bree asks Andrew one last time to come to the AA meeting, but he still says no. However, they end up having their own private meeting; just the two of them.Renee and Gaby have been planning a big party. Everyone is invited, but no one feels like going because of the Beth Young situation. That's not going to stop Renee from pressing forward with her fabulous spring fling.The night of the big party arrives and Renee's place is packed with a bunch of strangers. Gaby realizes the reason Renee wouldn't cancel the party is because her mother also committed suicide. This party is her way of dealing with it. Gaby then adds her name to the guest list in a show of support.==Reception==On its original broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the episode scored 9.047 million of viewers and achieved a 2.9 rating in the adults 18-49 demographic.
